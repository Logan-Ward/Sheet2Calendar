A program to fetch dates and times from a shared Google spreadsheet and add them to Google Calendar. The use case that inspired this was a spreadsheet of shifts for a job that I wanted to automatically fill out my calendar. The current implementation is targeted towards the format of that spreadsheet, but there is easily room for the logic to be expanded. No pretty formatting right now either. Potential convenience upgrade would be to make this a set and forget either by building a full website or converting it to a script that runs on some server somewhere. As it stands, I run this with live server and manually add the localhost port to the Google Workspace "Client ID for Web application".
